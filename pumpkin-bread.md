Preheat the oven to 350F.2. Mix the sugar, oil, eggs, pumpkin puree, salt, and spices together. Mix in the baking soda and flour.3. Grease a pan with oil, butter, or crisco. Pour the batter into the pan evenly.4. Bake the brownies for about 30 minutes. The top should be crispy and should not sink in when taken out of the oven. You can also stick a knife or toothpick into the middle of the loaf to check if it's done (knife or toothpick should come out clean with no batter attached). Let the bread cool, then you can cut into slices!    Notes-----    - You can play with the spice levels to taste preference.- This recipe also works for muffins if you have a muffin tin.- Can't really remember what recipe this is derived from, unfortunately, may update later.
