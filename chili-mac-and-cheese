Chili Mac and Cheese
=========

Servings: 5?

Ingredients
-----------

- olive oil
- 1 small onion
- garlic (however much you wanna add)
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons chili powder (or chipotle seasoning)
- 1 can of diced tomatoes	
- 1 can of tomato sauce
- 1 can of black beans
- 1 can of pinto beans
- 1 can of black beans
- 2 cups broth
- 1 box of macaroni noodles
- 1/2 pound of grated cheddar cheese

Equipment
---------

- Large pot 
- mixing spoon
- Cheese grater (if you have block cheese)

Steps
-----

1. Cut up the onions and garlic. It's probably also a good idea to open all of the cans of beans and drain them before starting to cook.
2. Saute the onion and garlic in olive oil in your pan until they're transparent-ish and wilty. Add the chili powder and flour and stir everything together for a minute or two.
3. Add all the beans, the diced tomatoes, the tomato sauce, the broth, and the macaroni noodles.
4. Stir everything together and then put lid on the pot. Turn up the stove heat a bit so the mixture will boil.
5. Once it's boiling you can turn down the heat and wait about 10 - 15 minutes for the macaroni to cook. Stir it every few minutes so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and to make sure the macaroni cooks evenly. This is a good time to grate your cheese if needed.
6. Add the cheese and stir it in until it's incorporated.

Notes
-----

- You can also add a can of corn with the beans if you want. You can also add more cheese if you want it to be cheesier.
