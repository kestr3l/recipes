Taco Soup
=========

Alternatively known as **chicken chili**.

Servings: approx. 10-12

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cans corn (any kind)
- 2 cans kidney beans
- 2 cans diced tomatoes
- 2 cans hominy
- 2 pounds chicken
- 2 packets taco seasoning
- Hot sauce(s) as desired
- Rice (optional)
- Shredded cheese (optional)

Equipment
---------

- Large (6+ quart) slow cooker
- Can opener

Steps
-----

1. Cut or shred the chicken into small, bite-sized pieces. The chicken will
   continue to tenderize and dissolve while cooking, so this doesn't have to be
   perfect.
2. Combine corn, beans, tomatoes, hominy, chicken, and seasoning in the slow
   cooker and mix thoroughly. If desired, add hot sauce. I prefer a bottle
   (yes, an entire bottle) of Tiger Sauce, generally found at Wegmans.
3. Cook in the slow cooker on low for a minimum of 6-8 hours. Serve in bowls.
   May be served over rice if desired. Sprinkling shredded cheese on top is
   also pretty great.

Notes
-----

- Many other types of beans can be substituted for the kidney beans.
- Some stores sell different kinds of diced tomato cans, like "spicy" tomatoes.
  These can be used to mix up the flavors.
- I usually can't find hominy at Wegmans, so I skip it.
- If served without rice, the dish can be fairly soupy, hence the name.
- Serving over rice can _really_ help with the spice if lots of hot sauce has
  been added
  * Rice is also a great way to stretch the recipe even further. I've been able
    to stretch this recipe for over two weeks by serving over some rice.
