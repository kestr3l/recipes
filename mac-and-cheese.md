Mac and Cheese
==============

Servings: 4-6

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 pound macaroni
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 4 cups whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 pound cheddar cheese
- 1.5 tablespoons dijon mustard
- paprika

Equipment
---------

- Large pot
- Colander
- 9x13 baking pan
- Mixing spoon

Steps
-----

1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
2. Cook macaroni in the pot until al dente. Drain in the colander and set aside.
3. Heat butter, flour, and milk together in the pot to make a white sauce. Once the butter has melted, add the salt, mustard, and cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted.
4. Add the cooked macaroni back into the pot and stir.
5. Pour into the baking pan.
6. (Optional) Melt 1/4 cup of butter in the small sauce pan. Crush the sleeve of ritz crackers and add to the butter. Sprinkle on top of the macaroni and cheese in the pan.
7. 
8. Bake for 45 minutes.

Notes
-----

- Try using a combination of sharp and mild cheddar for more interesting flavor combinations.
- If you have a sleeve of Ritz crackers, you can use them as a topping. Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a small sauce pan, crush up the sleeve of crackers, and add the crushed bits to the butter. Mix them together. Sprinkle the results on top of the macaroni and cheese before baking.
- An alternate topping is parmesan cheese - sprinkle a _ton_ on top of the dish before baking, and it should get nice and crispy.
- If you reheat in the oven instead of the microwave, the crispy parts will stay crisp!
