Green Bean Casserole
====================

Stolen with modification from the recipe on the can of Campbell's cream of
mushroom soup. Typically served as a side dish.

Servings: approx. 4-6

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 cans cream of mushroom soup
- 4 cans cut green beans
- 2 containers of fried onions
- 1 pack bacon bits

Equipment
---------

- Oven
- 9x13 baking dish (or casserole dish)
- Mixing bowl
- Spoon for mixing

Steps
-----

1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
2. Stir everything except one of the containers of fried onions together in the mixing bowl. Make sure to really drain the green beans first.
3. Add pepper to taste.
4. Dump into your baking dish.
5. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven. Spread the second container of fried onions over the top.
6. Bake for 5-10 more minutes, until the onions on top are golden brown.

Notes
-----

- To save dishes, you can use one of the soup cans to measure out the milk instead of using a measuring cup. About 3/4 of the can should be good.
- I suppose if you're really good you could mix everything right in the baking dish, but mine doesn't have very high walls so I use a separate mixing bowl to prevent spillover.
