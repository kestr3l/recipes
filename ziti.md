Ziti
====

Servings: depends on how hungry you are

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 box ziti
- 1 28oz jar pasta sauce
- 1 container ricotta cheese
- 1 16oz bag shredded mozzarella
- (Optional) 1 additional 16oz bag of cheese of your choice

Equipment
---------

- Big bowl
- Glass baking dish
- Oven

Steps
-----

1. Preheat the oven to 375F
2. Cook the ziti, drain it, and set it aside.
3. Mix in a large mixing bowl the ricotta, pasta sauce, and shredded cheeses. Once they are thoroughly mixed, add the cooked ziti and mix together.
4. Pour the cheese-and-pasta mixture into the baking dish and bake for about one hour.

Notes
-----

- You can actually use any kind of pasta for this, just don't tell anyone that it's not actually ziti.
- Highly recommended that you mix the ricotta and pasta sauce together _before_ adding the shredded cheese. Once the shredded cheese gets added the mixture gets much thicker, so you want the moisture of the ricotta and sauce in there first. Sometimes adding a bit of pasta water can help if the mixture is too thick to stir.
- One bag of cheese is pretty cheesy, but adding another bag of cheese makes it SUPER cheesy. I like using the "mexican" shredded cheese blends.
- Add some italian seasonings into the mixture if you feel fancy!
- Try setting aside some of the shredded cheese when mixing. Then once you pour the pasta into the baking dish, sprinkle the cheese on top. This will create a nice crust of slightly burnt cheese on top which is completely worth it.
